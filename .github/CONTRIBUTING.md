# How to contribute to MMT

## If you're a mathematician
You'll be very precious ! I'm not really good at that, and i'm lazy (that's why I'm doing this, ladies). I have only basics a Computer Science student would have in this domain. Here are some things you can do simply by talking in discussions :

- share any idea I could implement in the project that is not already stated in the Readme file
- share your knowledge and documentations

## If you're a developer
For now, and until the realease of the main module (V0.2.* if all goes right), there are no more way to contribute to the project

## If you're an english gramar lover
Well... I'm french, and I'm dyslexic... Bad combinasion, so I don't have the pretention to have a good english, and I'm open to any correction.

## If you're a graphist
How can I say it... I have no taste... at all ! Here are the things that could be more... hummmm... eyes-bleeding-less ? :
 - documentation files
